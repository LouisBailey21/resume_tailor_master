Professional Experience:

Senior Software Engineer at Softcom: 06/2022 - Current
•	Led the platform-wide modernization effort by decomposing a tightly coupled legacy application into independent microservices using ASP.NET Core, containerized with Docker, and orchestrated via Kubernetes. Migrating workloads to AWS (ECS, RDS, S3, CloudWatch) reduced infrastructure costs by 25%, improved deployment reliability, and increased system uptime to 99.97%, enabling on-demand scalability and region-specific failover.
•	Designed and implemented RESTful API gateways and internal services using .NET 6, TypeScript, and Node.js, establishing standardized service contracts for internal and external integrations. These APIs supported customer usage metering, billing, authentication, and workflow automations, and were hardened for multitenancy using strict isolation and tenant-aware logic.
•	Developed a centralized customer and user identity management service using Entity Framework Core, PostgreSQL, and Redis for session caching. This system unified authentication across web, mobile, and partner apps, and allowed dynamic permission and role mapping for thousands of enterprise tenants with complex access control models.
•	Built real-time communication and collaboration pipelines using SignalR, Azure Service Bus, and Redis Pub/Sub, enabling rich interactive features like presence detection, live updates, and cross-user notifications within a collaborative workspace UI. These capabilities were instrumental in expanding the platform's value to remote teams and distributed users.
•	Spearheaded the development of an integrated video calling and virtual meeting module using WebRTC, tightly coupled with the calendar, chat, and scheduling systems. Backed by ASP.NET Core APIs and a React Native frontend, the module improved product engagement and reduced churn for enterprise customers offering remote support or virtual consultation services.
•	Collaborated with data science teams to integrate machine learning models for customer behavior prediction and usage insights. We exposed TensorFlow models via RESTful endpoints using ASP.NET Core, and used them to power recommendation engines, usage alerts, and intelligent onboarding workflows — leading to a measurable drop in churn and a 21% increase in feature adoption.
•	Automated billing, usage tracking, and claims processing workflows using Azure Logic Apps, SQL Server, and Entity Framework, connecting seamlessly to third-party CRMs, payment gateways, and finance systems. These automations reduced manual data entry by over 40% and ensured accuracy in invoicing and revenue recognition.
